# Music Files

To add background music to your application, place your audio files in this folder.

## Supported Formats
- MP3 (.mp3) - Recommended for best compatibility
- OGG (.ogg) - Good for web, smaller file size

## File Names
The application is configured to look for:
- `background-music.mp3` (primary)
- `background-music.ogg` (fallback)

## How to Add Music
1. Place your music file in this folder
2. Rename it to `background-music.mp3` (or .ogg)
3. The music player will automatically detect and play it

## Recommended Music
For a romantic "thank you" application, consider:
- Soft, instrumental music
- Romantic ballads
- Gentle piano or acoustic guitar
- Music without lyrics to avoid distraction

## File Size
Keep your music file under 5MB for faster loading.

## Example
If you have a song called "my-song.mp3", rename it to "background-music.mp3" and place it here.
